A simple terminal input output talking chatbot using nltk and corpus english training. Self learning chatbot. Database used is mongoDB for large storage and json for faster retrivation.
What it does?
It simply give some wittyfull replies to your question and might also ask one. It learns from previously asked question by you and by analysing the words it gives the best probable answer. I have embedded google text to speech engine in this and hence the reply she gives is not only textual but also vocal.
What's the future?
I'm thinking of to develop this further by adding gui in it using some python graphics tools and also making it as seperate program for android. Can you guys help me out with this?
